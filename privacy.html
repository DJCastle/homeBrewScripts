          <p>Brew Scripts is an open-source project by CodeCraftedApps ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled when you use the Brew Scripts toolkit, visit this website, or interact with our GitHub repository.</p>

          <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
          <p>Brew Scripts is designed with a privacy-first approach. As open-source command-line tools that run entirely on your local machine, our scripts are built to respect your privacy by design.</p>

          <h2>Data the Scripts Collect</h2>

          <h3>Local Data Only</h3>
          <p>Brew Scripts operates entirely on your local machine. The scripts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> transmit any data to external servers owned by us</li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> collect analytics, telemetry, or usage statistics</li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> phone home or check for updates automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> require account creation or authentication with our services</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Log Files</h3>
          <p>The scripts create log files stored locally on your machine (typically in <code>~/Library/Logs/</code>). These logs contain:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Timestamps of script execution</li>
            <li>Names of packages installed or updated</li>
            <li>Success or failure status of operations</li>
            <li>System information (macOS version, architecture)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These log files remain on your device and are never transmitted to us. You may delete them at any time.</p>

          <h3>Configuration Files</h3>
          <p>Configuration files (such as <code>config/homebrew-scripts.conf</code>) are stored locally and may contain settings you provide, such as email addresses or phone numbers for notifications. This data is used only by the scripts running on your machine and is never sent to us.</p>

          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>The scripts interact with the following third-party services as part of their core functionality:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Homebrew (brew.sh):</strong> The scripts download and manage packages through Homebrew, which is subject to <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew's own policies</a></li>
            <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Source code is hosted on GitHub. Downloading or cloning the repository is subject to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a></li>
            <li><strong>Apple iMessage/Mail:</strong> If you configure notifications, the scripts use macOS built-in Mail and iMessage apps, which are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Website Data</h2>

          <h3>This Website</h3>
          <p>This website (brewscripts.codecraftedapps.com) is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics services on this site.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>GitHub Pages may collect standard server logs (IP address, browser type, pages visited) as part of hosting. See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a> for details</li>
            <li>Google Fonts are loaded from Google's CDN, which is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li>The scripts library loads manifest data from jsDelivr CDN, which is subject to <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jsDelivr's Privacy Policy</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Open-Source Transparency</h2>
          <p>As an open-source project, all code is publicly available for review on <a href="https://github.com/DJCastle/homeBrewScripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. You can inspect exactly what the scripts do before running them. This transparency is a core part of our privacy commitment.</p>

          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>Brew Scripts is a developer tool and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. As this is an open-source project, significant changes will also be reflected in the repository's commit history.</p>

          <h2>Parent Organization</h2>
          <p>Brew Scripts is a project of CodeCraftedApps.
