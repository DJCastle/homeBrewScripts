## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Read the documentation** thoroughly
2. **Understand the educational focus** - contributions should teach as well as function
3. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
4. **Test your changes** on a clean macOS system
5. **Follow the coding standards** outlined below

### Coding Standards

#### Shell Script Best Practices

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Always use bash shebang with env for portability

set -euo pipefail
# Always use strict error handling

# Use meaningful function names
validate_user_input() {
    local input="$1"
    # Function implementation
}

# Document complex logic
# This regex validates email addresses according to RFC 5322
if [[ "$email" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$ ]]; then
    return 0
fi
```

#### Documentation Standards

- **Every function** should have a comment explaining its purpose
- **Complex logic** should be explained with inline comments
- **Educational notes** should explain why something is done a certain way
- **Examples** should be provided for non-obvious usage

#### Configuration Management

- **External configuration** for all user-customizable values
- **Validation functions** for all configuration options
- **Default values** that work out of the box
- **Clear documentation** of all configuration options

#### Error Handling

- **Comprehensive validation** of all inputs and system state
- **Meaningful error messages** that help users understand and fix problems
- **Graceful degradation** when possible
- **Recovery suggestions** in error messages

### Testing Requirements

#### Before Submitting

1. **Syntax validation**: `bash -n script.sh`
2. **ShellCheck analysis**: `shellcheck script.sh`
3. **Dry-run testing**: Test with `--dry-run` mode
4. **Clean system testing**: Test on a system without Homebrew
5. **Documentation testing**: Verify all examples work

#### Test Scenarios

- **Fresh macOS installation** (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **Existing Homebrew installation**
- **Network connectivity issues**
- **Insufficient disk space**
- **Permission problems**
- **Configuration file errors**

## üöÄ Submission Process

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/homeBrewScripts.git
cd homeBrewScripts
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Use descriptive branch names
git checkout -b feature/improve-error-handling
git checkout -b docs/add-advanced-tutorial
git checkout -b fix/configuration-validation
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- **Follow coding standards** outlined above
- **Add tests** for new functionality
- **Update documentation** as needed
- **Add educational comments** to explain your approach

### 4. Test Thoroughly

```bash
# Validate syntax
bash -n *.sh

# Run ShellCheck
shellcheck *.sh

# Test with dry-run
./homebrew-setup.sh --dry-run --debug

# Test on clean system (VM recommended)
```

### 5. Commit with Clear Messages

```bash
# Use conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat: add configuration validation for email addresses

- Add regex validation for email format
- Include educational comments explaining regex
- Add test cases for common email formats
- Update documentation with validation examples"
```

### 6. Submit Pull Request

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** of what was changed and why
- **Educational value** explanation - how does this help users learn?
- **Testing performed** - what scenarios were tested
- **Breaking changes** - any changes that affect existing users

## üìñ Educational Focus Guidelines

### When Adding Features

Ask yourself:
- **Does this teach a useful concept?** New features should demonstrate good practices
- **Is it well-documented?** Code should be self-explanatory with good comments
- **Does it follow patterns?** Consistency helps users learn the overall approach
- **Is it safe?** Educational code should model safe practices

### When Writing Documentation

- **Explain the "why"** not just the "what"
- **Provide examples** for abstract concepts
- **Include common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Link to external resources** for deeper learning
- **Use progressive complexity** - start simple, build up

### When Fixing Bugs

- **Explain the root cause** in comments
- **Show the fix pattern** that can be applied elsewhere
- **Add validation** to prevent similar issues
- **Update documentation** to help others avoid the same problem
