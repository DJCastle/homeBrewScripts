                <p><strong>Stop and read this section completely before running any script.</strong> These scripts modify your system. While they include extensive safety measures, you must understand the risks and take appropriate precautions before proceeding.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <h3>What These Scripts Do</h3>
            <p>Understanding what automation scripts do to your system is the first and most important step toward using them safely. Brew Scripts performs the following types of operations on your Mac:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Install Software</strong> &mdash; The scripts download and install the Homebrew package manager along with any applications and command-line tools you specify in your configuration. This means new software is being added to your system that was not there before.</li>
              <li><strong>Modify System Files</strong> &mdash; Shell configuration files such as <code>.zshrc</code> and <code>.bash_profile</code> may be updated to add Homebrew to your PATH and configure your shell environment. These files control how your terminal behaves every time you open it.</li>
              <li><strong>Create Scheduled Tasks</strong> &mdash; If you set up automatic updates, the scripts create macOS launchd jobs that run in the background on a schedule. These jobs persist across restarts and will continue running until you remove them.</li>
              <li><strong>Network Operations</strong> &mdash; Packages and applications are downloaded from the internet via Homebrew's official repositories. This means network traffic is generated and bandwidth is consumed during installation and updates.</li>
              <li><strong>File System Changes</strong> &mdash; The scripts create directories for logs, configuration files, and caches. These are created in standard macOS locations and follow Apple's conventions for file organization.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Potential Risks</h3>
            <p>Every system automation tool carries inherent risks. Being aware of these risks allows you to make informed decisions and take appropriate precautions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>System Configuration Changes</strong> &mdash; Modifications to shell configuration files may affect how your terminal and other applications behave. If you have custom shell configurations, the scripts could potentially conflict with them.</li>
              <li><strong>Network Usage</strong> &mdash; Downloads can consume significant bandwidth, especially during initial setup when many packages are being installed simultaneously. Be mindful if you are on a metered connection.</li>
              <li><strong>Disk Space</strong> &mdash; Applications, their dependencies, and Homebrew's cache require storage space. A full installation with many applications can use several gigabytes of disk space.</li>
              <li><strong>Security</strong> &mdash; Installing any software carries some security risk. While Homebrew verifies package signatures and uses HTTPS for all downloads, you should always be aware of what you are installing.</li>
              <li><strong>Compatibility</strong> &mdash; Some applications may conflict with existing software on your system, particularly if you already have manually-installed versions of the same applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Built-in Safety Measures -->
            <h2 id="safety-measures">Built-in Safety Measures</h2>
            <p>Brew Scripts includes multiple layers of safety features designed to protect your system and give you full control over every operation. These measures are built into the core of every script, not bolted on as an afterthought.</p>

            <h3>Dry-Run Mode</h3>
            <p>The most important safety feature is dry-run mode. When you pass the <code>--dry-run</code> flag to any script, it simulates the entire operation without making any actual changes to your system. This lets you see exactly what would happen before committing to it.</p>
            <pre><code># See what would happen without making any changes
./brew_setup_tahoe.sh --dry-run

# Combine with debug mode for maximum detail
./brew_setup_tahoe.sh --debug --dry-run</code></pre>
            <p>During a dry run, the script validates your configuration, checks system requirements, tests network connectivity, and reports what it would install or modify. No files are changed, no software is downloaded, and no system settings are altered. Always run in dry-run mode first, especially when running a script for the first time or after making configuration changes.</p>

            <h3>Interactive Checkpoints</h3>
            <p>Every major operation is preceded by a checkpoint that asks for your explicit confirmation. You are never surprised by what the script does because it tells you what is about to happen and waits for your approval before proceeding.</p>
            <pre><code>checkpoint() {
    local message="$1"
    echo "CHECKPOINT: $message"
    if ! ask_yes_no "Continue with this step?"; then
        log_info "Skipping step as requested"
        return 1
    fi
}</code></pre>
            <p>At each checkpoint, you can choose to continue, skip the step, or stop the script entirely. Skipping a step does not affect subsequent steps &mdash; the script is designed to handle partial installations gracefully. This means you can always come back later and run only the steps you skipped.</p>

            <h3>Comprehensive Logging</h3>
            <p>Every operation performed by the scripts is recorded in a detailed log file with timestamps, severity levels, and descriptive messages. This creates a complete audit trail that you can review at any time.</p>
            <pre><code># All operations logged with timestamps
LOG_FILE="$HOME/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log"

# Example log entries
[2026-02-06 14:30:15] [INFO] Installing Visual Studio Code...
[2026-02-06 14:30:45] [SUCCESS] Visual Studio Code installed successfully
[2026-02-06 14:31:02] [WARNING] Slack already installed, skipping
[2026-02-06 14:31:10] [ERROR] Failed to install unknown-app: not found in repository</code></pre>
            <p>The log captures every command executed, all configuration changes made, error messages and stack traces, system state before and after operations, and all user choices and inputs. If something goes wrong, the log is the single best resource for understanding what happened and why.</p>

            <h3>Idempotent Operations</h3>
            <p>All operations in Brew Scripts are designed to be idempotent, meaning you can run them multiple times without causing problems. Before performing any action, the script checks whether the desired state already exists and skips the operation if it does.</p>
            <pre><code># Safe to run multiple times — checks before acting
if brew list --cask "$app" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then
    log_success "$app is already installed"
    return 0
fi</code></pre>
            <p>This design has several practical benefits. You can safely resume a script after an interruption without worrying about duplicate installations. If you run a script again after adding new apps to your config, it will only install the new ones and skip everything that is already in place. This idempotent design is a professional software engineering pattern that makes the scripts robust and forgiving.</p>

            <h3>Input Validation</h3>
            <p>Every piece of user input and configuration is validated before it is used. This prevents common mistakes from causing problems downstream, such as invalid email addresses, malformed file paths, or unsupported operating system versions.</p>
            <pre><code>validate_email() {
    local email="$1"
    if [[ ! "$email" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$ ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Invalid email format: $email" &gt;&amp;2
        return 1
    fi
}</code></pre>
            <p>Validation is performed early in the script's execution, during the pre-flight check phase. This means that if there is a problem with your configuration, you will find out immediately rather than discovering it halfway through a long installation process. The validation covers all user inputs, configuration file syntax, system requirements, and network and power conditions.</p>

            <h3>Error Recovery</h3>
            <p>When things go wrong &mdash; and with network operations, they sometimes do &mdash; the scripts handle failures gracefully. Transient errors such as network timeouts are automatically retried with exponential backoff, giving temporary issues time to resolve themselves.</p>
            <pre><code>retry_with_backoff() {
    local max_attempts=3
    local attempt=1

    while [[ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]]; do
        if "$@"; then
            return 0
        fi
        log_warning "Attempt $attempt failed, retrying..."
        ((attempt++))
    done

    log_error "All attempts failed"
    return 1
}</code></pre>
            <p>When retries are exhausted and an operation truly fails, the script logs a detailed error message and continues with the remaining operations rather than crashing. This graceful degradation means that a single failed app installation does not prevent all the other apps from being installed. At the end of the run, you get a clear summary of what succeeded and what needs attention.</p>

            <!-- Pre-Installation Checklist -->
            <h2 id="pre-installation">Pre-Installation Checklist</h2>
            <p>Before running any script for the first time, work through this checklist to make sure your system is prepared. Taking a few minutes to prepare will save you time and potential headaches later.</p>

            <h3>System Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later installed</li>
              <li>Administrator privileges (you know your password)</li>
              <li>At least 1GB free disk space available</li>
              <li>Stable internet connection active</li>
              <li>No critical work in progress (in case a restart is needed)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Back up your system</strong> using Time Machine or another backup solution. This is the most important preparation step. If anything goes wrong, a backup lets you restore your system to its previous state.</li>
              <li><strong>Close important applications</strong> to avoid conflicts during installation. Some apps may need to be restarted if they are updated via Homebrew.</li>
              <li><strong>Review the configuration file</strong> to understand what will be installed. Check each category toggle and the custom apps list to make sure nothing unexpected is included.</li>
              <li><strong>Test with dry-run mode</strong> first. This is your free preview of everything the script will do.</li>
              <li><strong>Have your password ready</strong> for administrator prompts. You will be asked for it at least once during the process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Network Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Connected to a reliable network with good throughput</li>
              <li>Sufficient bandwidth for potentially large downloads (some apps exceed 500MB)</li>
              <li>Not on a metered connection if data usage is a concern</li>
              <li>Firewall and proxy settings allow Homebrew downloads from <code>github.com</code> and <code>homebrew.bintray.com</code></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout callout-info">
              <div class="callout-icon">&#8505;</div>
              <div class="callout-content">
                <p><strong>Network tip:</strong> If you are on a corporate network with a proxy or firewall, you may need to configure Homebrew to use your proxy settings. Check with your IT department if downloads fail with network errors.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Best Practices for Usage -->
            <h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices for Usage</h2>
            <p>Following these best practices will help you get the most out of Brew Scripts while minimizing the chance of running into issues. These recommendations come from real-world experience and represent the safest, most effective way to use system automation tools.</p>

            <h3>1. Start Small</h3>
            <p>When you first begin, enable only one or two categories in your configuration rather than everything at once. This makes it easier to understand what each category installs and to troubleshoot any issues that arise. You can always add more categories later.</p>
            <pre><code># Start with a minimal configuration
INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS=false
INSTALL_PRODUCTIVITY_APPS=true
INSTALL_CREATIVE_APPS=false
INSTALL_COMMUNICATION_APPS=false
INSTALL_UTILITIES=true</code></pre>
            <p>As you become more comfortable with the scripts and understand what each category contains, gradually enable additional categories. This incremental approach reduces the surface area for problems and makes it clear which category introduced any issues.</p>

            <h3>2. Use Dry-Run Mode First</h3>
            <p>This is worth repeating because it is the single most important best practice. Always test your configuration with <code>--dry-run</code> before running for real. Make it a habit &mdash; even when you think you know what will happen.</p>
            <pre><code># Always test before applying
./brew_setup_tahoe.sh --dry-run

# For extra detailed output, add the debug flag
./brew_setup_tahoe.sh --debug --dry-run</code></pre>

            <h3>3. Review Logs Regularly</h3>
            <p>After each script run, take a moment to review the log file. Look for warnings and errors that might indicate issues requiring your attention. This is especially important for automated update runs where you might not see the console output.</p>
            <pre><code># Check what happened during the last run
tail -50 ~/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log

# Search for errors specifically
grep ERROR ~/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log

# Watch the log in real-time during a script run
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log</code></pre>

            <h3>4. Keep Your Config Under Version Control</h3>
            <p>Your configuration file represents your system setup preferences. Treating it like code by keeping it under version control lets you track changes over time, revert to previous versions if a change causes problems, and easily replicate your setup on new machines.</p>
            <pre><code># Create your config from the example template
cp config/homebrew-scripts.example.conf config/homebrew-scripts.conf

# Track configuration changes with Git
git add config/homebrew-scripts.conf
git commit -m "Initial configuration"</code></pre>

            <h3>5. Test in a Safe Environment</h3>
            <p>For significant changes or when experimenting with modifications to the scripts themselves, consider testing in a virtual machine first. Tools like UTM or Parallels Desktop can run macOS in a virtual environment where you can safely experiment without risking your primary system. This is especially valuable if you are customizing the scripts for your own needs.</p>

            <!-- Emergency Procedures -->
            <h2 id="emergency-procedures">Emergency Procedures</h2>
            <p>Even with all the safety measures in place, things can occasionally go wrong. This section describes what to do if you encounter problems during or after running the scripts. The most important thing is to stay calm &mdash; nearly every issue is recoverable.</p>

            <h3>If Something Goes Wrong</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Do not panic.</strong> Most issues are recoverable, and the scripts are designed to fail safely without leaving your system in a broken state.</li>
              <li><strong>Check the logs.</strong> Open <code>~/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log</code> and look for ERROR entries near the bottom of the file. The log will usually tell you exactly what went wrong.</li>
              <li><strong>Stop the script</strong> if it is still running by pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code>. The script will clean up after itself and exit gracefully.</li>
              <li><strong>Document the issue.</strong> Note what you were doing when the problem occurred, any error messages you saw, and the steps that led up to the failure. This information is invaluable for troubleshooting.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Recovery: Homebrew Installation Issues</h3>
            <p>If Homebrew itself fails to install or ends up in a broken state, you can remove it completely and start fresh. The Homebrew project provides an official uninstall script for this purpose.</p>
            <pre><code># Remove incomplete or broken Homebrew installation
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"

# Clean up any Homebrew-related lines from your shell config
# Open ~/.zshrc in a text editor and remove lines mentioning Homebrew
nano ~/.zshrc</code></pre>

            <h3>Recovery: Application Installation Failures</h3>
            <p>If a specific application fails to install or is not working correctly after installation, you can remove it through Homebrew and try again, or clear the download cache to force a fresh download.</p>
            <pre><code># Remove a failed application
brew uninstall --cask problematic-app

# Clear the Homebrew download cache
brew cleanup --prune=all

# Try installing again
brew install --cask problematic-app</code></pre>

            <h3>Recovery: Shell Configuration Problems</h3>
            <p>If your terminal starts behaving strangely after running the scripts, the issue is likely in your shell configuration file. You can back up the current version and restore the system default to get back to a working state.</p>
            <pre><code># Back up the current (potentially broken) configuration
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.broken

# Reset to the macOS system default
cp /etc/zshrc ~/.zshrc

# Or restore from your own backup if you have one
cp ~/.zshrc.backup ~/.zshrc

# Restart your terminal to apply the changes</code></pre>

            <div class="callout callout-warning">
              <div class="callout-icon">&#9888;</div>
              <div class="callout-content">
                <p><strong>When to seek professional help:</strong> If your Mac will not boot, contact Apple Support. If applications from outside Homebrew are affected, check the application's own support resources. If you see persistent permission errors, you may need to reset file permissions using Disk Utility's First Aid feature.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Security Considerations -->
            <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>
            <p>Security is a fundamental concern when running any automation script. Brew Scripts is designed with security in mind, but understanding the security model helps you make informed decisions about how and when to use the scripts.</p>

            <h3>Script Security</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Source verification</strong> &mdash; Only run scripts from trusted sources. The official Brew Scripts repository is hosted on GitHub, and you should always download from the official URL.</li>
              <li><strong>Code review</strong> &mdash; Every script in this project is fully open source and extensively commented. You are encouraged to read and understand the code before running it. If something looks unfamiliar, look it up or ask before executing.</li>
              <li><strong>Checksum verification</strong> &mdash; If you downloaded the scripts as a ZIP file, compare the file size and contents against what is shown on the GitHub repository to ensure nothing was tampered with during transit.</li>
              <li><strong>Sandbox testing</strong> &mdash; When possible, test scripts in an isolated environment such as a virtual machine before running them on your primary system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Application Security</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Official sources</strong> &mdash; Brew Scripts only installs software from official Homebrew repositories, which are curated and maintained by the Homebrew community. This means you are getting the same versions that millions of other users depend on.</li>
              <li><strong>Signature verification</strong> &mdash; Homebrew verifies application signatures automatically before installation. If a package's signature does not match, the installation is refused.</li>
              <li><strong>Update management</strong> &mdash; Keeping applications updated is one of the most important things you can do for security. The auto-update feature helps ensure your installed software receives security patches promptly.</li>
              <li><strong>Permission review</strong> &mdash; After installing new applications, review the permissions they request. macOS will prompt you for camera, microphone, and file access permissions as needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Network Security</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>HTTPS only</strong> &mdash; All downloads use encrypted HTTPS connections. No data is transmitted in plain text.</li>
              <li><strong>Certificate validation</strong> &mdash; SSL/TLS certificates are validated for every connection, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
              <li><strong>No credential storage</strong> &mdash; The scripts never store your passwords, tokens, or other credentials. Your administrator password is passed directly to macOS for authentication and is not logged or saved.</li>
              <li><strong>Audit trails</strong> &mdash; All network activity is logged, so you can review exactly what was downloaded and from where.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Customization Guidelines -->
            <h2 id="customization">Customization Guidelines</h2>
            <p>One of the strengths of Brew Scripts is that it is designed to be customized. Whether you are adjusting the configuration to match your preferences or modifying the scripts themselves to add new functionality, these guidelines will help you do so safely and effectively.</p>

            <h3>Safe Modifications</h3>
            <p>These are changes that carry minimal risk and are fully supported by the scripts' design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Configuration changes</strong> &mdash; Modify <code>config/homebrew-scripts.conf</code> to change which applications are installed, adjust notification preferences, and customize scheduling. The configuration file is designed to be the primary customization point.</li>
              <li><strong>Application lists</strong> &mdash; Add or remove applications in the configuration. Homebrew has thousands of packages and casks available, and you can include any of them.</li>
              <li><strong>Scheduling</strong> &mdash; Adjust auto-update schedules to fit your work patterns. You might prefer updates to run overnight, on weekends, or at a specific time each day.</li>
              <li><strong>Notification preferences</strong> &mdash; Choose between email, text message, or both for update notifications. You can also disable notifications entirely if you prefer to check logs manually.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced Modifications</h3>
            <p>These changes require some shell scripting knowledge and should be tested thoroughly before deploying:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Function additions</strong> &mdash; Add new functions to <code>lib/common.sh</code> to extend the scripts' capabilities. Follow the existing function patterns for consistency.</li>
              <li><strong>Validation rules</strong> &mdash; Enhance input validation to enforce custom requirements specific to your environment.</li>
              <li><strong>Error handling</strong> &mdash; Improve error recovery mechanisms for scenarios specific to your setup.</li>
              <li><strong>Logging enhancements</strong> &mdash; Add more detailed logging for operations you want to monitor closely.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Testing Your Changes</h3>
            <p>After making any modifications to the scripts, always validate your changes before running them for real. Here is a quick three-step testing process:</p>
            <pre><code># Step 1: Validate shell syntax (catches typos and syntax errors)
bash -n your-modified-script.sh

# Step 2: Run ShellCheck for deeper analysis (catches common pitfalls)
shellcheck your-modified-script.sh

# Step 3: Test with dry-run and debug mode enabled
./your-modified-script.sh --dry-run --debug</code></pre>

                <p><strong>Remember:</strong> When in doubt, do not run it. It is always better to understand what a script does before executing it on your system. Take your time, read the code, and ask questions.
