# 🛡️ Safety and Best Practices Guide

This guide explains the safety measures built into these scripts and provides best practices for using and modifying system automation scripts.

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Information

### Before You Begin

**STOP AND READ THIS SECTION COMPLETELY**

These scripts will modify your system. While they include extensive safety measures, you must understand the risks and take appropriate precautions.

### What These Scripts Do

1. **Install Software**: Homebrew package manager and applications
2. **Modify System Files**: Shell configuration files (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.)
3. **Create Scheduled Tasks**: Automatic update jobs via macOS launchd
4. **Network Operations**: Download packages and updates from the internet
5. **File System Changes**: Create directories, log files, and configuration files

### Potential Risks

- **System Configuration Changes**: May affect how your shell and applications behave
- **Network Usage**: Downloads can consume bandwidth and data
- **Disk Space**: Applications and caches require storage space
- **Security**: Installing software always carries some security risk
- **Compatibility**: Some applications may conflict with existing software

## 🛡️ Built-in Safety Measures

### 1. Dry-Run Mode
```bash
# See what would happen without making changes
./homebrew-setup.sh --dry-run
```

**What it does:**
- Shows all operations that would be performed
- Validates configuration without applying it
- Tests network connectivity and system requirements
- No actual system modifications are made

### 2. Interactive Checkpoints
```bash
checkpoint() {
    local message="$1"
    echo "CHECKPOINT: $message"
    if ! ask_yes_no "Continue with this step?"; then
        log_info "Skipping step as requested"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

**Benefits:**
- You control each major operation
- Can skip steps you don't want
- Provides information before each action
- Allows you to stop at any point

### 3. Comprehensive Logging
```bash
# All operations logged with timestamps
LOG_FILE="$HOME/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log"

# Example log entry
[2025-01-11 14:30:15] [INFO] Installing Visual Studio Code...
[2025-01-11 14:30:45] [SUCCESS] Visual Studio Code installed successfully
```

**What's logged:**
- Every command executed
- All configuration changes
- Error messages and stack traces
- System state before and after operations
- User choices and inputs

### 4. Idempotent Operations
```bash
# Safe to run multiple times
if brew list --cask "$app" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    log_success "$app is already installed"
    return 0
fi
```

**Benefits:**
- Running scripts multiple times won't cause problems
- Can resume after interruptions
- Won't duplicate installations or configurations
- Detects existing state before making changes

### 5. Input Validation
```bash
validate_email() {
    local email="$1"
    if [[ ! "$email" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$ ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Invalid email format: $email" >&2
        return 1
    fi
}
```

**Protections:**
- All user inputs are validated
- Configuration files are checked for syntax
- System requirements verified before proceeding
- Network and power conditions checked

### 6. Error Recovery
```bash
retry_with_backoff() {
    local max_attempts=3
    local attempt=1
    
    while [[ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]]; do
        if "$@"; then
            return 0
        fi
        log_warning "Attempt $attempt failed, retrying..."
        ((attempt++))
    done
    
    log_error "All attempts failed"
    return 1
}
```

**Features:**
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming services
- Graceful degradation when operations fail
- Clear error messages with recovery suggestions

## 📋 Pre-Installation Checklist

### System Requirements
- [ ] macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- [ ] Administrator privileges (you know your password)
- [ ] At least 1GB free disk space
- [ ] Stable internet connection
- [ ] No critical work in progress (in case restart is needed)

### Preparation Steps
- [ ] **Backup your system** (Time Machine or other backup solution)
- [ ] **Close important applications** to avoid conflicts
- [ ] **Review the configuration file** to understand what will be installed
- [ ] **Test with dry-run mode** first
- [ ] **Have your password ready** for administrator prompts

### Network Considerations
- [ ] Connected to a reliable network
- [ ] Sufficient bandwidth for downloads (some apps are large)
- [ ] Not on a metered connection (if data usage is a concern)
- [ ] Firewall/proxy settings allow Homebrew downloads

## 🔧 Best Practices for Usage

### 1. Start Small
```bash
# Begin with minimal configuration
INSTALL_DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS=false
INSTALL_PRODUCTIVITY_APPS=true
INSTALL_CREATIVE_APPS=false
INSTALL_COMMUNICATION_APPS=false
INSTALL_UTILITIES=true
```

### 2. Use Dry-Run Mode First
```bash
# Always test before applying
./homebrew-setup.sh --dry-run
./homebrew-setup.sh --debug --dry-run  # For detailed output
```

### 3. Review Logs Regularly
```bash
# Check what happened
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log

# Search for errors
grep ERROR ~/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log
```

### 4. Keep Configuration Under Version Control
```bash
# Track your configuration changes
git init config/
git add config/homebrew-scripts.conf
git commit -m "Initial configuration"
```

### 5. Test in Safe Environment
- Use a virtual machine for testing major changes
- Test on a non-critical system first
- Have a rollback plan for important systems

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Don't Panic**: Most issues are recoverable
2. **Check the logs**: `~/Library/Logs/HomebrewSetup.log`
3. **Stop the script**: Press `Ctrl+C` if it's still running
4. **Document the issue**: Note what you were doing when it failed

### Common Recovery Steps

#### Homebrew Installation Issues
```bash
# Remove incomplete Homebrew installation
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"

# Clean up shell configuration
# Edit ~/.zshrc and remove Homebrew-related lines
```

#### Application Installation Failures
```bash
# Remove failed application
brew uninstall --cask problematic-app

# Clear Homebrew cache
brew cleanup --prune=all
```

#### Shell Configuration Problems
```bash
# Backup current configuration
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup

# Reset to system default
cp /etc/zshrc ~/.zshrc

# Or restore from backup
cp ~/.zshrc.backup ~/.zshrc
```

### When to Seek Help

- **System won't boot**: Contact Apple Support or a technician
- **Applications won't start**: Check application-specific support
- **Network issues**: Verify internet connection and firewall settings
- **Permission errors**: May need to reset file permissions

## 🔒 Security Considerations
